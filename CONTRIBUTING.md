## Meetups

We welcome anyone who would like to join and contribute. We meet regularly every month in Vienna through the Data Science Cafe meetup of the VDSG, show our progress and discuss the next steps. Please follow [our meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Vienna-Data-Science-Group-Meetup/) to get updates regarding our next meeting.

## Web Miner

This repository deploys a web miner, that given a specific set of sources (URLs), should locate new documents (web-pages) and save them in the DB for future processing

### Recommended tools:

We lean heavily on existing tools as well as developing our own new methods. Among the existing tools we are using [scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) which later we hope to host on [scrapy-cloud](https://scrapinghub.com/scrapy-cloud).
Another related tool that should be considered is [scrapy-splash](https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash) which can render JS-based pages before storing them.
[Textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract) can be used to extract the content, the text, to be saved.

### Vision & Roadmap

We want to use this goal also as a reason to have a playground to implement, test, hack and compare different solutions.

## I have different skills

If you wish to assist in different aspects, such as Data Science, Data Engineering, Web development, DevOps, we have divided the project to several additional repositories focusing on these topics.
